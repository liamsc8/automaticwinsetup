# Automatic Windows Setup

This new windows utility allows you to skip the OOBE and go straight to your windows account!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 # How to use
 
Install windows like normal, then once you get to the OOBE press SHIFT+CTRL+F3. This will put your PC into audit mode. Once you are in audit mode go to https://github.com/liamsc8/automaticwinsetup/releases/tag/V.1.0.1 then download the latest version then run it. Then follow the instructions in the app. After you are done entering all the info it will ask you to restart the computer, after that you should be in your account!
